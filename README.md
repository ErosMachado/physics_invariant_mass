Can you relate the existence of the Higgs boson to this data?

The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, responsible for giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism. In experiments such as those conducted at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider), one of the ways to identify the Higgs boson was to observe its decay products.

​Expression of invariant mass:

$`m_H^2 = (E_{\mu^+} + E_{\mu^-})^2 - (\vec{p}_{\mu^+} + \vec{p}_{\mu^-})^2`$

Where $`m_H`$ would be the mass of the Higgs boson. If a particle with the mass of the Higgs boson is produced and decays into two muons, the invariant mass of these two muons must correspond to the mass of the Higgs boson, which is about 125 GeV/c².

The data were obtained from ICTP-SAIFR, through work monitored by Professor Isabela Maietto Silvério.
